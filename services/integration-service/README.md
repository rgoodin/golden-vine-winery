# Integration Service

Receives `DistributorOnboardingRequested` events from Salesforce and
creates a ServiceNow Incident for each one. See the root
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for the full architecture and phase roadmap.

## Status: Phase 1's first milestone achieved — full chain proven end-to-end

Salesforce → integration-service → ServiceNow works, live:
`Distributor_Onboarding_Requested__e` (full canonical field set — see
`docs/decisions/0003-platform-event-schema.md`) is published, received via
a real Pub/Sub API gRPC subscription, mapped onto the canonical nested
`DistributorOnboardingRequestedEvent` shape (`src/types/events.ts`), and
used to create a real ServiceNow Incident
(`docs/decisions/0004-servicenow-authentication.md`). See
`docs/devex/observations.md` (OB-0006) and `docs/devex/friction-log.md`
(FL-0001–FL-0010).

## Stack

- Node.js + TypeScript
- Trigger mechanism: Salesforce Platform Event via the Pub/Sub API (see
  `docs/decisions/0001-integration-architecture.md`)
- Salesforce auth: OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Flow (see
  `docs/decisions/0002-authentication-strategy.md`)
- Pub/Sub API client: `@grpc/grpc-js` + `@grpc/proto-loader` against
  Salesforce's officially published `pubsub_api.proto`
  (`src/salesforce/proto/`), with Avro payload decoding via `avsc`
- ServiceNow auth: OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant, dedicated
  `itil`-role user (see `docs/decisions/0004-servicenow-authentication.md`)
- ServiceNow target: Incident, via the Table API
  (`src/servicenow/incidentAdapter.ts`)

## Setup

```
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill in .env - see docs/decisions/0002-authentication-strategy.md and
# 0004-servicenow-authentication.md for what each value corresponds to
```

## Run

```
npm run dev

# in another terminal, to test:
npm run publish-test-event -- "Some Distributor Name"
```

## What's deliberately not here yet

- Retry / dead-letter handling
- Idempotency handling
- Tests
- A narrower ServiceNow OAuth Auth Scope (currently relies on the
  dedicated user's `itil` role rather than API-level token scoping — see
  friction-log.md FL-0010)

These are left out per `CLAUDE.md`'s "smallest useful change" principle —
they'll be added once Phase 1 friction shows what's actually needed. With
10 friction items logged, a Phase 2 (Observation Review) pass is worth
doing before adding more code.
